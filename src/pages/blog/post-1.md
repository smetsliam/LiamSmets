I think people too often fill in my thoughts with: “Oh, I’m doing fine” or “You look okay, so there must be nothing wrong.” But on the contrary, there is much more going on than you think!

Friends, parents, family, etc. Listen, STOP filling in my thoughts. It only makes it harder for me to talk about it. I mean expressing my feelings to you. But no one understands me. I put on a mask in public: at home, with family, friends, acquaintances, etc. But from the moment you stop filling in my thoughts, that mask will come off, but that rarely happens.

It just rarely happens, so we are not there yet with what I actually want to say. I wanted to say just stop it because it’s not nice for me. If you do that, then yes, I will shut myself off from you, and then you will suddenly see me in the room making an attempt.

Would you rather have me not be here one day than for you to stop filling in my thoughts at some point? That would be very nice, otherwise my thoughts won’t end.

My thoughts mean that I am not heard by others. By that, I mean filling in thoughts for me/saying act normal/being casual about it and yes, just filling in everything for me. But not listening to what I need.

If you stop doing that, then I can also agree to try to learn to talk about my feelings, but from the moment you start filling in again, my effort stops, and it could be that I am no longer here.
